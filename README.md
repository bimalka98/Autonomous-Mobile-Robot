[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/bimalka98/Autonomous-Mobile-Robot?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

This repository includes all the project files related to development of an `Arduino based autonomous mobile robot`. The project is being done by a team of 5 undergraduates at Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Following figure illustrates the `initial prototype` of the planned mobile robot design and it may be subjected to various changes during the actual robot implementing stage due to possible reasons.

## Current Status of the Project

* Algorithms were developed. 
* Working on coding.
* Physical Robot building stage was initialized.

Brief introduction about the files in repository are given below.
## Documentation
`Documentation` folder includes some of the important documents related to the design of mobile robot.


#### ArduinoMega2560.pdf
This document includes information about `peripheral circuitry` of the ArduinoMega2560(Rev3).

#### How to choose the correct servo.pdf
This document includes necessary calculations to choose the correct servo motors for the given task.

#### L298N Motor Driver Logical Functionality.pdf
Underlying logical Functionality of the L2968N motor driver is shown by a truth table.

#### Motor_selection.pdf
calculations required to determine the motor for the mobile robot are explained in this document.

#### Power_source_selection.pdf
calculations required to choose the proper power source for the mobile robot are described in the document.

#### Robot Mechanical Design.pdf
The initial prototype of the mobile robot and the mechanical parts of the robot are explained in this document.

#### Robot Sensors.pdf
Sensors used in building the robot is described in this document in descriptive manner and drawbacks of other Sensors are also included.

#### Subsumption Architecture.pdf
A summary on the `Subsumption Architecture` is given in this document. It is very robust  Control system Architecture which was introduced by R. A. Brooks of MIT in 1985.


## Arduino Sketches
This folder contains the most fundamental Arduino sketches for various sub tasks encountered while designing the robot.
* Drive a Servo motor
* Drive a DC motor through L298N motor driver
