# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot

This repository includes all the project files related to development of an Arduino based autonomous mobile robot.
The project was done by a team of 5 undergraduates at Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering,
University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Brief introduction about the files in repository are given below.

## Documentation
Documentation folder includes some of the important documents related to the design of mobile robot. Calculations required to make decisions when choosing correct components to build the robot are explained.

## Arduino Sketches
This folder contains the most fundamental Arduino sketches for various sub tasks encountered while designing the robot.
* Drive a Servo motor
* Drive a DC motor through L298N motor driver
